This is readme file.
MD stands for markdown.

A README.md file in a Git repo is there to explain what the project is about — in simple terms, it's like the homepage or instruction manual for your code.

✅ Purpose of README.md
📖 Tells people what the project does

🛠️ Shows how to install and use it

🙋‍♂️ Guides contributors on how to help

📦 Often shows up automatically on GitHub/GitLab project pages

✅ Why .md?
.md stands for Markdown — a simple way to format text (like bold, lists, code blocks).

It's easy to write and renders nicely online (e.g., GitHub makes it look like a web page).
